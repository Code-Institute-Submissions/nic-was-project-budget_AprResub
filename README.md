# PROJECT BUDGET README
Project budget allows a user to create, edit, view and delete projects and to add and delete budgets linked to those projects.


## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to allow a user to log in, create budgets for projects that you might have that require some savings and edit those budgets. The user can only see their data when they are logged in.  


## Features

2. Login page for existing users
3. Projects page where existing projects can be viewed, edited or deleted. New projects can be added too.
